#vVgrant config for torch and opencv
This is a vagrant wrapper to run torch based model. Used for video so openCV is included (see http://code-chronicle.blogspot.fr/2014/08/connect-usb-device-through-vagrant.html for setting up usb passthrough). Here made for mac
Long to load but working. Both .sh script can be used independently

#Caveat
Only on cpu, use the included script to convert from GPU machine. Note you have to do it on a machine with a GPU.

#Use
`vagrant up`
